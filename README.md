## Introduction
Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualisation.
## Prerequisites
Before using the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
-Python 3.x
-Pandas
-Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib

# Getting Started
1. Data Preparation
- Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "2.1_Population_dynamics.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
- The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age').

2. Running the Script
- Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
- Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python environment.

3.Executing the Visualization
- Run the script.
- The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population dataset.

# Usage
Use this project to:
- Gain insights into the age distribution of a population.
- Visualise age demographics for various analysis purposes.

# Customization
You can customise the visualisation by making the following modifications to the code:
- Replace 'Age' in df['Age'] with the actual column name containing age data in your dataset.
- Adjust the appearance of the bar chart, such as labels, colours, and size, to suit your preferences.
